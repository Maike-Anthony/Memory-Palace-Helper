                    <h2>Finding Memory Palaces</h2>
                    <p>If you are having trouble finding memory palaces, you might use <a href="https://forum.artofmemory.com/t/the-big-list-location-ideas-inspiration-for-memory-palace-places/92451?u=mike4">this list of ideas</a> to help you recall places you already know. It’s also possible to use virtual memory palaces, which are places you never visited in real life. <a href="https://artofmemory.com/blog/virtual-memory-palaces/">This website</a> explains how you can build and use them.</p>

                    <h2>How to Memorize Numbers</h2>
                    <p>Number memorization usually includes converting digits into consonant sounds by following some set of premade rules. These sounds are then used to form words, encoding the original numbers. This technique is called the Major System, and you can learn more about it <a href="https://artofmemory.com/blog/major-system/">here</a>, or you might watch this 5-minute video by the USA Memory Champion Joshua Foer:</p>

                    <h2>How to Memorize Texts</h2>
                    <p>The two main types of memorization, historically distinguished by ancient rhetoricians like Cicero, are memoria verborum (memory for words), which is precise, word-for-word recall, and memoria rerum (memory for things/ideas), which focuses on concepts, arguments, and the essence of the information. The following is a list of resources for those interested in memorizing books or texts verbatim:</p>

                    <h2>How to Review (Anki)</h2>
                    <p>Even the best memory methods require reviewing, or else the content will inevitably be forgotten. That is when <a href="https://apps.ankiweb.net/">Anki</a> comes into place. Anki is a free, open-source flashcard app that uses spaced repetition and active recall to make learning efficient and boost long-term memory retention, ideal for memorizing complex information like languages or medical facts. It schedules reviews for cards just before you're likely to forget them, adapting to your performance by showing difficult material more often and easy material less frequently, allowing you to study smarter, not harder.</p>
