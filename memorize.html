                    <div class="question">What if I can't think of an image to represent the item?</div>
                    <p class="answer">Ask yourself: “What is the first thing that comes to my mind when I think of it?” This spontaneous answer will often be the best image because it uses the existing connections in your brain. Alternatively, you may focus only on the first syllable or two and try to create an image for that. In other words, the image does not need to represent the entire word. Sometimes representing just the beginning is enough to make you remember the entire word.</p>

                <li>
                    <div class="question">How can I make the image more memorable?</div>
                    <p class="answer">Always remember this: the more emotional, the more memorable. If your image contains and/or provokes weirdness, anger, lust, disgust, fear, amusement, or any other emotion, then it's probably memorable. If the image looks like something you could see in a normal day, then it's probably not as memorable. For example, instead of imagining an apple on a kitchen table, imagine that your table is a huge apple or that there is a giant humanoid apple pissing on your table.</p>

                <li>
                    <div class="question">How can I improve the clarity of my imagination?</div>
                    <p class="answer">The mental imagery only needs to be clear enough for you to be able to recall the items later. If the image is blurred, but you can still recall the list correctly, then it is okay. In fact, there are even people with aphantasia (inability to produce mental imagery) who use the Memory Palace method. If you still want to improve your visualization, you can do exercises, trying to gradually increase the complexity of your images after each session.</p>

                <li>
                    <div class="question">What if the item contains numbers?</div>
                    <p class="answer">Number memorization usually includes converting digits into consonant sounds by following some set of premade rules. These sounds are then used to form words, encoding the original numbers. This technique is called the Major System, and you can learn more about it in the resources page.</p>
